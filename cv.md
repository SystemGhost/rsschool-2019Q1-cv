## Summary

My goal is to become a good front-end programmer and work in EPAM. I really enjoy working with HTML, CSS and JS. And to become one needs to constantly evolve. The world is changing, as well as technology. Therefore it is necessary to learn and learn again. Although I have a little experience, but I quickly learn.
